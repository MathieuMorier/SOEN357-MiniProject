                        <p>
                            In recent years, the intersection
                            of healthcare and technology has
                            gained significant momentum. As global
                            longevity continues to rise, societies
                            are faced with a compelling
                            challenge: while people are living
                            longer, the years added to
                            their lives are not necessarily
                            healthy ones. According to the
                            World Health Organization, while Canadians
                            now enjoy an average lifespan
                            of 82.8 years, an impressive
                            surge from the 1960s, their
                            healthspan—the period in one’s life
                            devoid of chronic illnesses or
                            debilitating conditions—ends over a decade
                            earlier. This means that many
                            elderly individuals spend a substantial
                            part of their life coping
                            with health and social challenges.
                            <br><br>
                            The Covid-19 pandemic has further
                            accentuated this issue. As the
                            virus spread rapidly, elderly individuals,
                            particularly those in nursing homes
                            or living alone, faced heightened
                            risks, leading to recommended or
                            enforced isolation. Such isolation, though
                            critical for physical safety, often
                            inadvertently deteriorated mental well-being, triggering
                            feelings of loneliness and disconnect.
                            <br><br>
                            In this evolving landscape, technology
                            offers a beacon of hope.
                            Mobile applications and pervasive computing
                            can bridge the gap, offering
                            tools and platforms that not
                            only connect the elderly to
                            their loved ones but also
                            monitor and enhance their physical
                            and mental well-being. However, the
                            adoption rate of such technologies
                            among the elderly remains suboptimal,
                            primarily due to design issues.
                            A significant portion of technology
                            solutions are not tailored to
                            the elderly's unique needs, taking
                            into account their potential physical,
                            cognitive, or technological limitations.
                            <br><br>
                            Thus, the primary goal of
                            this project is to design
                            an application that holistically addresses
                            these challenges. The app aims
                            to foster a sense of
                            connection and provide tools to
                            promote physical and mental health
                            for the elderly, especially during
                            times of social distancing or
                            self-quarantine. By placing the unique
                            needs and preferences of the
                            elderly at the forefront of
                            the design process, this app
                            will strive to offer an
                            elder-friendly interface that is intuitive,
                            accessible, and most importantly, beneficial.

                            We faced challenges in ensuring accessibility and intuitive design, recognizing
